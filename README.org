* Emacs support for ghc-imported-from

[[http://melpa.org/#/ghc-imported-from][file:http://melpa.org/packages/ghc-imported-from-badge.svg]]     [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/ghc-imported-from][file:http://stable.melpa.org/packages/ghc-imported-from-badge.svg]]

** Purpose
This is an Emacs front-end for Carlo Hamalainen's =ghc-imported-from=,
a command-line tool for finding Haddock documentation for symbols in
Haskell source files. Because it uses =cabal= and =ghc=, it's
sandbox-aware.

It requires that you have a copy of =ghc-imported-from= available. You
can get it from Hackage with =cabal install ghc-imported-from=, or get
the source from [[https://github.com/carlohamalainen/ghc-imported-from][GitHub]].

** Instructions
After installing the package, simply bind the command to a key in
=haskell-mode-map=. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load 'haskell-mode
          `(define-key haskell-mode-map
                       (kbd "C-c C-d d")
                       #'ghc-imported-from-haddock-for-symbol-at-point))
#+END_SRC

If =ghc-imported-from= is not on Emacs's default path, then you can
customize the variable =ghc-imported-from-command-name= to point it at
the correct absolute path.
