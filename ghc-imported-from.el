;;; Commentary:

;; This is an Emacs frontend for ghc-imported-from, a command-line
;; tool for finding Haddock documentation for symbols in Haskell
;; source files. Because it uses cabal and ghc, it's sandbox-aware.

;;; Code:

(defgroup ghc-imported-from nil
  "Customization for `ghc-imported-from'"
  :group 'haskell
  :prefix 'ghc-imported-from)

(defcustom ghc-imported-from-command-name "ghc-imported-from"
  "The command to run for ghc-imported-from"
  :type 'file
  :group 'ghc-imported-from)

change this.
